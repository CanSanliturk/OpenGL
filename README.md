OpenGL
---
This is a repository that I created to practice OpenGL. I set up my working around by simply downloading and building files given at
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/opengl-man-pages/ . 

FirstProgram
---
This file includes sample for drawing a 2D triangle. I just copied it from OpenGL's own documentation.

RCBeam
---
This file will include simple 3D sketch of reinforced concrete beam. After completing these, I will use it for visualizing the output of my 
RC member design algorithm (see https://github.com/CanSanliturk/StrutAndTieAnalysisAndDesignFramework)
